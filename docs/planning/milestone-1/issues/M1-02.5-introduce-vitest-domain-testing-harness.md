## [Governance] Introduce Vitest testing tooling (domain harness)

## Problem Statement

Milestone 1 will introduce the first domain invariant:

Exactly one `DRAFT` MenuVersion must exist at all times.

Currently, the repository has no deterministic, fast testing harness to validate domain logic
independently from Prisma or the database.

Without a testing harness, invariant enforcement risks becoming brittle or coupled to persistence.

---

## Why This Matters Now

Testing must precede invariant enforcement.

Before implementing M1-03 (single DRAFT invariant), we need:

- A DB-free unit test harness
- Fast execution feedback
- TypeScript-compatible test execution
- Confidence that domain logic is pure and deterministic

This issue establishes the testing foundation for all future domain invariants.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Vitest installed as a dev dependency
- [ ] Minimal Vitest configuration added (compatible with current module system)
- [ ] `npm run test` script added
- [ ] `npm run test:watch` script added
- [ ] One trivial passing test exists in the domain layer
- [ ] Test execution runs without Prisma or database dependency
- [ ] TypeScript compilation and lint checks continue to pass

---

## Scope & Constraints

In scope:

- Install Vitest
- Add minimal configuration file (if required)
- Add test scripts to `package.json`
- Add one trivial sanity test under domain directory
- Confirm tests run successfully

Out of scope:

- Integration tests
- Repository adapter tests
- Database tests
- UI tests
- Invariant tests (introduced in M1-03)

Constraints:

- Tests must be DB-free
- Domain tests must not import Prisma
- Configuration must remain minimal
- Avoid introducing unnecessary tooling complexity

---

## Architectural Notes

Testing discipline is part of the architecture.

This harness will be used to enforce:

- Workspace invariants
- Ordering invariants
- Validation logic

Domain invariants must be testable without database setup.

---

## Verification Notes

From a clean working tree:

- `npm run test` passes
- `npm run test:watch` runs correctly
- `npm run check` continues to pass
- No Prisma client or DB connection is required for tests
