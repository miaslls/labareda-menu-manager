## [Governance] Create canonical labels and milestone structure

## Problem Statement

Issues must be consistently classifiable (type/area) and trackable to milestones.

Without labels and milestones, execution will be harder to coordinate and review.

---

## Why This Matters Now

The project uses milestone-based capability boundaries and a strict issue → PR workflow.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Canonical label set exists in the repository
- [ ] Milestones 0–5 exist in GitHub and match MILESTONES.md titles
- [ ] Labels can be applied to issues via GitHub UI and CLI

---

## Scope & Constraints

In scope:
- Create labels in GitHub
- Create milestones in GitHub

Out of scope:
- Project boards (optional later)
- Automated label enforcement

---

## Verification Notes

- A newly created issue can be assigned a milestone and labels without manual label creation.
