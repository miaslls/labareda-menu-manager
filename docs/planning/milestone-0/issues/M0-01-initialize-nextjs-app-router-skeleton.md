## [Feature] Initialize Next.js App Router skeleton

## Problem Statement

The project requires a working Next.js App Router skeleton before domain modeling begins.

Without a bootable application, later work cannot be integrated or validated end-to-end.

---

## Why This Matters Now

Milestone 0 establishes the technical foundation required for all future milestones.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Next.js App Router project is created
- [ ] Local development server starts successfully
- [ ] Default route renders without error

---

## Scope & Constraints

In scope:
- Next.js project initialization

Out of scope:
- Domain modeling
- Database integration
- Authentication

---

## Verification Notes

- `npm run dev` starts and the app renders in the browser with no runtime errors.
