## [Documentation] Finalize setup instructions in README

## Problem Statement

The project must be reproducible from a clean clone using documented steps.

Without precise setup docs, onboarding and self-review become fragile and error-prone.

---

## Why This Matters Now

Milestone 0 requires a reliable bootstrap path before any domain work begins.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] README includes a complete setup sequence: clone → install → env → migrate → run
- [ ] A clean clone can run the application without undocumented steps
- [ ] Commands are copy/paste friendly and correct

---

## Scope & Constraints

In scope:

- Setup instructions in README

Out of scope:

- Deployment instructions
- CI instructions (optional later)

---

## Verification Notes

- Following the README steps from a clean clone results in a running dev server.
