## [Documentation] Add branch naming reference

## Problem Statement

Branch naming rules exist, but there is no single reference mapping approved branch names to current
milestone issues.

Without a quick reference, naming drift and cognitive overhead increase during milestone execution.

---

## Why This Matters Now

This is a lightweight governance improvement that reinforces execution discipline and reduces
friction as issue count grows.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `docs/governance/BRANCH_NAMING_REFERENCE.md` exists and is committed
- [ ] The reference includes issue-to-branch mappings for the current milestone
- [ ] Rules align with the repository branching strategy

---

## Scope & Constraints

In scope:

- Add the reference file under `docs/governance/`
- Include branch naming rules and approved patterns

Out of scope:

- Automated enforcement (optional later)
- Retroactive renaming of existing branches (unless necessary)

---

## Verification Notes

- The file exists, is tracked, and is referenced when creating branches
- Branch names created for issues match the reference
