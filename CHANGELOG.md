# Changelog

This file records user-visible capability changes and operational milestones for the repository.

The project follows milestone-based delivery. Entries are written when a milestone closes or when behavior changes in a way that affects users or contributors.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0

Repository baseline and Milestone 0 work-in-progress foundation.

- Governance and workflow infrastructure (templates, labels, milestones, protected main).
- Next.js App Router skeleton.
- TypeScript and ESLint configured with a unified `check` script.
- Prisma 7 configured with SQLite and deterministic client output.
- Initial migration created (smoke test model).

Notes:
- Milestone 0 is closed only after clean-clone setup is verified and README setup steps remain sufficient.
